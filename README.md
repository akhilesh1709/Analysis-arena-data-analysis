Institute name: SASTRA University

### Problem statement

Explore the Pok√©mon dataset to uncover interesting insights and solve the following optimization problem

### File Descriptions

- `Pokemon_data_analysis.ipynb` - Contains the code used for designing and training the model
- `Analysis_arena.pdf` - Report document


### Implementation Details
- **Data Preprocessing:** The dataset is preprocessed to handle any missing values.
- **Train-Test Split:** The dataset is split into a training set and a test set.
- **Model Training:** The Stacking Regressor model is defined along with RidgeCV estimator and is used to train the dataset.
- **Model Evaluation:** The trained model is evaluated on the test data to assess its performance in prediction.

### Requirements
  - Python 3.x   

### Libraries:
  - pandas
  - scikit-learn (sklearn)
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn

- **Data Preparation:** Load the dataset or a new dataset in a format suitable for training the model.
- **Run the Code:** Execute the code that trains the model and evaluates its performance on the test data.
- **Analyze Results:** Examine the evaluation metrics and predictions generated by the model to gain insights into its performance.
